In order to set up your Cryptfire Capsules for testing and later production scaling, you only need one line.
This will set up multiple cost-effective cloud servers for development purposes. You need a domain to get started.
We recommend Namecheap.

```
curl https://install.cryptfire.io/dev | sh
```

The development capsules shouldn't be used for production, as they aren't performant, nor are they clean for security
after playing around for while. Set up a fresh, optimized, production cluster:


```
curl https://install.cryptfire.io/prod | sh
```
